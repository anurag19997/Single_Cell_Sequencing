 1. First performed single cell clustering in tumor samples
 
 2. Used Leiden clustering and UMAP visualization on cancer and immune cells
 
 3. Investigated how the AXL-high or MITF-high on the bulk RNASeq level can be deconvoluted in single-cell level to get an idea about intra-tumor heterogeneity.
